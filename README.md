Chatting Web : http://ec2-18-224-94-64.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3456/~Josalyn/client.html

Description:
We created a chatting room using Node.js. After logging into our chatting room, the user can create a room. Once room created, users can see the current room created by all users.

For the private room part, users can create/join the chatting room with password protected. Once users join the chatting room, they can see all users in room.

The creator of the room is allowed to kick people in the chatting room or ban people that they can never enter into the room. The users who didn't create the room have no right to kick people.

There always exists a public chatting place for all users in the room
Once entering into private chatting room, users can send private message to particular person.

Creative part:
1. All users are allowed to invite people to join the room. Once click the inviation button, the user who is to be invited can see the invitation message through web window. If this user accept it, he/she can autimatically join the chatting room.
2. All users can go out the private chatting room by clicking the "out of this room" button
